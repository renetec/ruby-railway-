# Docker to Development Branch Sync Plan

## Goal
Copy Docker files (the "good" version) to local Git, then push to development branch

## Current Situation
- **Docker Container** (localhost:3000) = ✅ Good, working version
- **Local Git** (/home/rene/ruby) = ❓ May be outdated/different  
- **GitHub development branch** = ❓ May be outdated

## Sync Steps

### 1. Sync Docker → Local Git Repository
```bash
docker cp pacomien:/app/. /home/rene/ruby/
```
- Overwrites local files with Docker's good version
- Ensures local Git matches working Docker

### 2. Switch to Development Branch
```bash
git checkout development
```

### 3. Stage and Commit All Changes
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Sync Docker container files to development branch"
```

### 4. Push to GitHub Development Branch
```bash
git push origin development
```

### 5. Verify Sync
- Check file timestamps
- Compare key files between Docker and Git
- Confirm development branch is updated on GitHub

## Expected Result
- Development branch = Docker files (good version)
- Ready for future development workflow
- Can safely make changes knowing Docker and Git are synced

## Next Steps After Sync
- Development branch becomes your working branch
- Make changes in development → push → merge to main → Railway

## Why This Order?
1. **Docker → Local** = Gets the "good" files from Docker
2. **Local → Development** = Updates development branch with good files
3. **Development → GitHub** = Makes development branch available remotely

## Backup Created
- Image backup: `pacomien-backup-20250724`
- File backup: `/home/rene/docker-backups/pacomien-20250724-113319/`
