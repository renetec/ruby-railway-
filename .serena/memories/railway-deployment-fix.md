# Railway Deployment Fix - July 24, 2025

## Problem
Railway app at https://ruby-production-4cc9.up.railway.app was returning 404 errors and containers were starting then immediately stopping.

## Root Causes Found
1. **Git sync issue**: 18 local commits weren't pushed to remote main branch due to git permission issues
2. **Routing issue**: Health endpoint `/health` was inside locale scope, making it inaccessible for Railway health checks
3. **Missing Puma config**: No `config/puma.rb` file for proper server startup
4. **Production config issues**: 
   - Forced SSL conflicted with Railway's SSL termination
   - Static file serving was disabled
   - Host authorization was blocking Railway requests

## Solutions Applied
1. **Fixed git permissions**: `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .git/`
2. **Fixed health route**: Moved `/health` endpoint outside locale scope in `config/routes.rb`
3. **Added Puma config**: Created `config/puma.rb` with Railway-compatible settings
4. **Fixed production config**: Modified `config/environments/production.rb`:
   - Disabled forced SSL for Railway environment
   - Enabled static file serving for Railway
   - Disabled host authorization for Railway

## Key Files Modified
- `config/routes.rb` - Moved health endpoint outside locale scope
- `config/puma.rb` - Added Railway-compatible server configuration
- `config/environments/production.rb` - Fixed production settings for Railway

## Commands Used
```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .git/
git add [files]
git commit -m "Fix description"
git push origin main
```

## Result
Railway app now starts successfully and is accessible. Health endpoint works at `/health`.
